<p>In this post, I walk through building a full-stack project combining data engineering and machine learning to forecast house prices in Australia.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Extract, transform, and load Australian house price time series into PostgreSQL, then train forecasting models and build a dashboard to visualize predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, Prophet, XGBoost, Streamlit</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Hereâ€™s the system design:</p>

<h2>Data Engineering: ETL Pipeline</h2>
<p>I used the ABS Residential Property Price Indexes dataset, with historical median prices by capital city (quarterly data). It was downloaded and processed into a clean format.</p>
<p><code>extract.py</code> loads the raw XLSX; <code>transform.py</code> cleans and feature-engineers the time series; <code>load.py</code> uploads everything into PostgreSQL.</p>

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p>With clean data in PostgreSQL, I retrived it in Python for modeling:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prophet:</strong> Time-series forecasting per state or capital city.</li>
  <li><strong>XGBoost:</strong> Regression using lag features, macro time-index variables.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Forecast Storage & Dashboard</h2>
<p>Predictions from both models are stored in a <code>price_forecasts</code> table in PostgreSQL. Using Streamlit, I built an interactive dashboard to select state or suburb, view historical vs forecasted trends, and compare models.</p>

<h2>Results & Key Learnings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Built automated ETL pipeline with proper validation</li>
  <li>Achieved accurate forecasts at both state and suburb levels</li>
  <li>Learned end-to-end integration of engineering and ML workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automate ETL scheduling with Airflow or Prefect</li>
  <li>Containerize components using Docker</li>
  <li>Deploy database and UI to AWS (RDS, S3, Lambda/ECS)</li>
  <li>Add CI/CD via GitHub Actions</li>
</ul>
